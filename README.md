# About this repository

This contains the Lund & Bendsen course on Microservices, Java edition

# Viewing slides

The slides are in [org mode](https://orgmode.org/) format, which GitHub renders natively. Just view them online.

- One org mode heading per slide

# Presenting

The original author has a preference for [org-tree-slide](https://github.com/takaxp/org-tree-slide), but org mode's built-in [beamer](https://orgmode.org/worg/exporters/beamer/tutorial.html) support probably works fine (and can create PDFs).
