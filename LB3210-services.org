* Introduction
* Design for resilience
* Break(out) 1
** Service discovery
*** Introduction
- Break into teams of 2-4 people (20 min)
http://github.com/jypma/LB3210
- Discuss the services and projects you've been a part of, and identify:
  * Examples of a microservice
  * Examples of /definitely NOT/ a microservice

- For each service found, describe how /resilient/ the given service was
  * Usage or absence of /bulkhead/ and/or /circuit breaker/
  * Usage or absence of clustering / replication

*** Discussion
- Describe the services you have found
* Infrastructure architecture
* TODO Break(out) 2
* Data architecture
* TODO Break(out) 3
* Wrapping up today
* Start of day 2
* Getting your service used
* An introduction to REST
* Breakout 4: Finding REST services
** Assignment
- Divide into teams
- Find documentation of REST services
  + Internally published in your company
  + Publically on the internet
- Create a full example request for each service
  + Request headers and (if relevant) body
  + Response status line, headers, and (if relevant) body
  + Bonus points if you can actually execute the request!
** Presentation of results
* A selection of REST patterns
* REST API Examples
* Break(out) 5
** Designing an API
*** Write a RAML file for an invoicing API
- We're writing an invoicing service, that can send and receive invoices between companies

- We need APIs to:
  * Send an invoice
  * Read back previously-sent invoices
  * Check if we have received any invoices, and
  * Read received invoices

- You don't have to design an invoice format
  * You can assume they're plain text or PDF, if you want

- View [[file:demo-project/documentation/demo-api.raml]] if you need an example RAML file
- Hints:
  * RAML documentation and on-line editor: https://raml.org/
  * RAML 1.0 spec: https://github.com/raml-org/raml-spec/blob/master/versions/raml-10/raml-10.md/
* Micro service life cycle
* Security architecture
* Strategy and team dynamics
* TODO Break(out) 5
